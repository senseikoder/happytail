Puppies are some of the most adorable things on earth.  However, bringing a new puppy home can be a major lifestyle adjustment. In order to help you, we have written down some tips on growing your new friend.

### Establish a bathroom routine

Housetraining becomes a high priority on most puppy owners’ list of must-learn tricks. Your best allies will be patience, planning, and positive reinforcement. It will be a good idea to put a carpet-cleaning battle plan in place, because accidents will happen.

Until your puppy has had all of her vaccinations, try to find a place outdoors that is inaccessible to other animals to reduce the chances your dog can get sick. Make sure to give lots of positive reinforcement whenever your puppy manages to potty outside and refrain from punishing them when they have accidents indoors.

### Most common times to take your puppy out:

* When you wake up
* Before bedtime
* Right after your puppy eats or drinks a lot of water
* After your puppy wakes up from a nap
* During and after physical activity

### Watch for signs of illness

Puppies are more susceptible to sudden bouts of illnesses that can be serious if not caught in the early stages. If you observe any of the following symptoms in your puppy, it’s time to contact the vet:

* Lack of appetite
* Tiredness
* Poor weight gain
* Vomiting
* Swollen of painful abdomen
* Diarrhea
* Difficulty breathing
* Pale gums
* Nasal discharge
* Swollen, red eyes or eye
  discharge
* Inability to pass urine or stool

### Teach obedience

Teaching your pup to obey commands such as sit, stay, down, and come will help keep your dog safe and under control in any potentially hazardous situations. 

Many puppy owners find that obedience classes are a great way to train both owner and dog. Classes typically begin accepting puppies at age 4 to 6 months.

### Be sociable

At approximately 2 to 4 months of age, most puppies begin to accept other animals, people, places, and experiences. Ask your vet about what kind of interaction is OK at this stage.

### Puppy-proof home

This means taping loose electrical cords to baseboards; storing household chemicals on high shelves; removing plants, rugs, and breakables; setting up the crate; and installing gates. If you have children, hold one meeting to lay down the rules: 

* Who will be in charge of feedings three to four times a day?
* Who will make veterinary appointments for vaccinations and deworming?

House training your puppy is about consistency, patience, and positive reinforcement. The goal is to instill good habits and build a loving bond with your pet.
