Does your dog hate to take baths? Fortunately, there are steps you can take to make bath time less stressful for you and your dog. Check out these simple tricks to make dog's bath time easier and more pleasant:

**Brush before and after the bath.** This will help to remove any dirt or dead hair as well as prevent you from pulling on wet matted tangles while they are in the tub.

**Place your dog on a nonslip mat.** Few things stress out a dog more than not being able to stand without slipping. Giving dogs something to sink their toes into while standing will help ease their anxiety about baths. 

**Use the right shampoo.**  Ask your veterinarian or a professional groomer to recommend a product that works best for your pet. If your dog has skin problems, you'll likely need a therapeutic shampoo that will address their condition. The better the quality of the shampoo you use the better the outcome of the bath.   

**Try to keep shampoo out of your dog’s eyes**. If shampoo gets into your dog’s eyes this can be very uncomfortable flush your pets eyes with clean water or saline solution.

**Offer treats and praise.** Combine your dog's bath with tasty treats, plenty of praise, and even a toy that's reserved especially for bath time.

**Use the three-towel trick**. Have one towel to put in the bottom of the tub to provide traction and prevent slipping. Drape the second towel over the wet dog to prevent them from shaking and soaking you and the walls. The third towel is the drying towel.  

**Rinse thoroughly.** It's easy to miss shampoo residue, especially between your dog’s toes. This may cause your dog to lick and irritate their skin, so rinse thoroughly and make sure there is no soap residue remaining when you’re done.

**Dry thoroughly.** Dogs love to run and roll after a bath. If they are still wet they will pick up all kinds of
things from the ground and ruin all the work you just put in.

**Bathe your dog less frequently.** On average, once a month is plenty for most dogs. However, ask your veterinarian what the correct interval would be for your dog's coat type and lifestyle.

**Put your pet in the tub with as little drama as possible.** Lead your dog to the water offering positive cheer and treats along the way. Don’t lose your cool if your dog resists — if they already dislike bathing, an association with your angry voice won't help. 

### Other useful tips:

* Check the temperature of the water coming from the tap. It may be too chilly for your dog even on a warm day.
* If you’re using the tub, fill it with three or four inches of lukewarm water, about the same temperature you’d use for an infant. 
* Gently place a cotton ball inside each ear if your dog will let you. They’ll help keep water out of their ears, potentially diverting a secondary bacterial ear infection.  
* Rinse until the water runs clear. This can take some time for a long-haired breeds, but it's important to get all soap off your pet. Soap left on your pet will dry and can irritate their skin.
* Finish your dog's bath time with a treat. Try to offer the same prize every time so they connect their bath with this trophy.
