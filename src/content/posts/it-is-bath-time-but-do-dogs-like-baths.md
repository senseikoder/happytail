If you ask me about my dogs, the answer is YES!!! However, it depends on the dog. Some dogs and breeds have anxiety when it’s bath time, while others are very comfortable with baths as they are naturally attracted to water. 

For dogs with bath anxiety, we recommend giving your pet something to focus on, like toys or treats. You can also try bathing them like a baby — forgoing the shower head and using a bucket and small cup to pour water over them.

After a bath, some dogs might have a lot of excited energy to burn off. They could start to run around of even shake, this is natural, and nothing to be concerned about. This is most likely energy they need to release after being in the tub.

### How often should you bathe your dog?

The answer varies, depending on breed, lifestyle and coat. Do they spend their days frolicking in the grass and playing in the mud, or are they lap dogs who would rather cozy up inside?

It also depends on their hair length. According to our experience at Happy Tail Grooming, medium and long coat dogs should bathe every four to six weeks, and owners of dogs with short coats should bathe their pets somewhere every six to eight weeks.

Knowing when and how often to bathe your dog can be a combination of knowing your dog is in need of a bath naturally due to the frequency needed, or if they get excessively dirty and need attention immediately. Dogs tend to roll in things they shouldn’t, may require more frequent bathes. Use your sense of smell and touch to determine if your dog is in need of a bath, more frequently than recommended. 

### Things that determine the frequency of your dog’s baths

### Lifestyle

If we work up a sweat at the gym or get dirty doing yard work, we take a shower. Well, the same rule applies to our pups. Active dogs are going to require more frequent bathing, that means at least once every two weeks.

However, if your dog loves swimming in the ocean, rolling around in mud, or any other activity where they clearly get dirty, you should give them a bath after each activity.

On the other hand, if your dog mainly stays at home rather than be the outdoorsy adventurer, you must avoid over-bathing; they may only need a bath a handful of times a year.

### Coat Type

When it comes to length, dogs with medium to long coats should get frequent baths, usually every four to six weeks. Dogs with short coats usually require a bath ever six to nine weeks.

Dogs like Poodles and Bichons have soft coats that dirt tends to cling to. Likewise, drop-coated breeds like Yorkshire Terriers, Shih Tzu, and Lhasa Apso also tend to collect oil and debris, and need frequent bathing to ensure their coats look and smell fresh.

Some vet suggests bathing hairless dogs and breeds with oily coats, like Labrador Retrievers and Basset Hounds, about once a week. This helps to protect their skin from absorbing bacteria, pollutants, and toxins that are naturally eliminated when a furrier or hairier dog sheds.

Thick and double-coated breeds, like Huskies and Golden Retrievers, can be bathed every one to three months. These dogs are prone to shedding, and when a dog sheds, naturally rids itself of dead skin cells and bacteria that could be harmful.

### Skin Conditions

Some dogs have skin conditions or a temporary skin infection that requires frequent application of a special dog shampoo prescribed by a vet.

The frequency at which you should bathe your dog with a medicated shampoo will depend on your dog’s skin condition, the product you use and your veterinarian’s recommendation. 

If you think your pup needs a special shampoo, talk to your veterinarian.

### Can You Bathe a Dog Too Much?

What if your dog is really into bath time, and you absolutely love the idea of having a squeaky-clean, yummy-smelling pup 24/7? Definitely yes, you could be bathing your dog too much. 

Similar to how hairdressers advise against shampooing our hair every day, veterinarians and dog groomers say that too many baths can do more harm than good because it can affect the overall coat quality and strip their natural oils, which cause irritation. If you bathe your dog weekly pay attention to your dog’s skin, if you see any redness, irritation, or other skin conditions take not of these. These could be signs of over bathing which is causing their skin to dry. 

***Happy bath time!***
