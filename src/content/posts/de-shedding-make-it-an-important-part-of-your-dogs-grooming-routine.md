A dog’s hair grows in cycles, and shedding is a normal part of their hair life cycle. While all dogs shed to some degree, some breeds are more prone to shedding than others, such as Husky, Golden Retriever, Bernese Mountain, and German Shepherd.

Dogs have two main types of coats: topcoat, and undercoat which keeps your dog warm in the winter and cool in the summer. However, not all dogs have both a top coat and an undercoat. Poodles, doodles, terries and Maltese are considered single-coat dogs.

While dogs shed year-round, seasonal shedding happens twice a year. Once the weather becomes warmer and the undercoat falls out, and again when the weather cools and the topcoat fall out.

De-shedding is the removal of the dog’s loose undercoat hair; hair that will eventually end up on your furniture and clothing. You can help this process along by having them de-shed by a groomer. This process helps the dog get rid of most of this undercoat quickly, reducing the amount of hair left around your home and also speeding up the shedding process making your dog more comfortable.  

Different coat types

If you push back the top coat of your dog or cat, it’s likely that you’ll see a different type of fur, sometimes of a different color, underneath.

Some pets shed more than others, and some don’t really shed at all. Some breeds, such as poodles, don’t have an undercoat. Their fur grows consistently and sheds less, meaning they need to be clipped regularly.  

A Few Good Reasons to De-shed Your Dog 

If you're a dog owner, you know if your furry friend sheds a lot, and it can be a real hassle to clean up all that hair. However, regular de-shedding can provide many benefits for both you and your dog. 

1.	It helps to reduce the amount of hair that your dog sheds, which means you'll spend less time cleaning up after them. This is particularly important for people who suffer from allergies or asthma.

2.	It reduces the amount of hair your dog ingests, which in some cases lead to hairballs and digestive issues. This is especially important for long-haired breeds, as they are more likely to develop these problems. 

3.	It helps to improve your dog's coat and skin health. When you remove the excess hair, you allow air to circulate around your dog's skin, which can help to prevent hot spots and other skin irritations. 

Regular de-shedding can also help to distribute your dog's natural oils throughout their coat, which can make their fur softer, shinier and healthier. 

4.	Avoid unpleasant matting! De-shedding aids in the natural shedding process. While it won’t be able to remove all of the undercoat, it will help protect your pet from unexpected and painful mats. 

5.	Strengthen the bond between you and your dog. When you personally take time to groom your dog, you're showing them that you care about their well-being, and this can help to strengthen the trust and bond between you. 

How to de-shed your pet

De-shedding on a weekly basis as part of your regular grooming routine can really help to control the amount of fur around your home. 

After you’ve removed any tangles or mats, brushing or combing with de-matting spays, take a de-shedding tool and gently stroke through your pet’s coat, working from the base of the neck to the tail. Repeat once or twice each week for 10 to 20 minutes. 

We recommended using de-shedding treatments at least once every 3 months, this time line could vary depending dog's breed and coat type. For example, dogs with double coats, like Huskies or Golden Retrievers, may need more frequent de-shedding.

Take some time to de-shed your dog on a regular basis, and both you and your furry friend will reap the benefits.
