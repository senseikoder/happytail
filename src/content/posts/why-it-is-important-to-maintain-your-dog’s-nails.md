Nail trimming is an essential part of dog grooming, trim nails are one clear sign of your dog’s good health and hygiene. 

When dogs spend a good deal of time outdoors, running on various hard surfaces, their nails are gradually worn down, and they have less of a need for formal nail-grooming sessions. 

But nowadays, with many dogs confined indoors when their owners are at work, and running mostly on soft surfaces such as lawns when they are outdoors, this welcome friction is often absent in their daily lives.

When nails grow too long that they constantly touch the ground, they exert force back into the nail bed, creating pain for the dog. This pain is similar to the pain a person feels when they wear a pair of shoes 1 or 2 sizes too small. This pain also increases the pressure on the toe joint.  

When your pup is young, overgrown nails can lead to broken nails, especially in a drier climate. With mature dogs, untrimmed nails can cause splayed or deformed feet, reduced traction, injured tendons, arthritis and eventually cause pain. 

A dog’s nails should be trimmed every 2 weeks depending on your pup’s growth rate. At the very least, they should be trimmed every 4 weeks. That frequency may seem like a lot, but the more you trim them, the less you have to trim off.  

This isn’t just an aesthetic problem: Compromising your dog’s weight distribution and natural alignment can leave them more susceptible to injuries, and make walking and running difficult, and painful. This is especially important in older dogs, whose posture can be dramatically improved by cutting back neglected nails.

In extreme cases, overgrown nails can curve and grow into the pad of the foot. But even if they are not that out of control, long nails can get torn or split, which is very painful and, depending on the severity, and extreme conditions may need to be treated by a veterinarian which can be very costly for you and painful for your dog.
