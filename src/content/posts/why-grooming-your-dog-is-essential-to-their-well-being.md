Whether you do the grooming yourself or bring your pet to a professional groomer, the reasons why you need to groom your dog are numerous.  

Grooming isn't just about your dog's aesthetic appearance. It's also about their health, and some of the grooming tasks are imperative for your pet's well-being. 

At-home grooming isn't as difficult as it seems. Indeed, with a bit of research and some advice from a professional groomer, you'll be able to handle most of your dog's grooming needs at home.  

For more advanced tasks like expressing your dog's anal glands and cutting their hair, you may want to hire a professional pet groomer.
