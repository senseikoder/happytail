            <span class="icon fa-solid fa-quote-left"></span>Happy tail grooming
            did an EXCELLENT job grooming my 15 year old shih-tzu. My dog was
            relaxed & looked so cute. Impressed with the skill, communication,
            timeliness & professionalism! Highly recommend.<span

            <span class="icon fa-solid fa-quote-left"></span>Catherine has been
            grooming my black standard poodle, Splendor for about three years
            now. She does an amazing job. She makes her look like a show dog
            even though she is not. Above Catherineâ€™s grooming skills what I
            really like and appreciate about Catherine is how much my dog loves
            her. You know when someone is treating your dog right. Splendor
            having a positive experience at the groomers is just as important to
            me as her haircut. I highly 100% recommend Catherine and Happy Tail
            Grooming.<span class="icon fa-solid fa-quote-right"></span>

            <span class="icon fa-solid fa-quote-left"></span>Catherine knows
            exactly how to take care of my Goldendoodle. She has been grooming
            her for 3 years now. I feel very relieved to have someone so
            talented and loving taking care of my dog. I am always surprise to
            see Sahara (pictured attached) after her grooming as she always
            comes out looking more beautiful with pretty bows and/or scarfs.<span
