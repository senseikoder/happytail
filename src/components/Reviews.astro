               <p><span class="icon fa-solid fa-quote-left"></span>Catherine has been grooming my black standard poodle, Splendor for about three years now. She does an amazing job. She makes her look like a show dog even though she is not. Above Catherineâ€™s grooming skills what I really like and appreciate about Catherine is how much my dog loves her. You know when someone is treating your dog right. Splendor having a positive experience at the groomers is just as important to me as her haircut. I highly 100% recommend Catherine and Happy Tail Grooming.</p>
